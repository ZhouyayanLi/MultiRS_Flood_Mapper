# MultiRS Flood Mapper Tutorial

This is the tutorial for MultiRS Flood Mapper (referred to as Flood Mapper), a Google Earth Engine Application for surface water body mapping.  The Flood Mapper works on imagery (Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8) of users' choice and customizable date range and study region.  It is integrated with Quantile-based Filling and refining (QFR) post-process to be able to generate good results in complex hydro- and geospatial conditions, such as in areas **under the control of hydraulic structures**, areas that are **densely vegetated**, and areas that are **contaminated by cloud**.

The Flood Mapper is designed with user-friendliness in mind, catering to both technical and non-technical users. It incorporates most computational steps, including the often laborious preprocessing and postprocessing, seamlessly integrated to activate upon mouse actions like clicking and dragging. This integration ensures an efficient and accessible experience for all users.
